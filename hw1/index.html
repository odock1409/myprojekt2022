    <p> Homer Jay Simpson (born May 12, 1956)[36] is the main protagonist of The Simpsons series (or show). He is the
        spouse of Marge Simpson and father of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson. Homer is overweight (said to be ~240
        pounds), lazy, and often ignorant to the world around him. Although Homer has many flaws, he has shown to have
        great caring, love, and even bravery to those he cares about and, sometimes, even others he doesn't. He also
        serves as the main protagonist of the The Simpsons Movie.</p>

            ―Homer when something good happens to him.
        </li>

        <p> Bartholomew "Bart" Jojo Simpson (born April 1[7] or February 23[8]) is the mischievous, rebellious,
            misunderstood, disruptive and "potentially dangerous" oldest child of the Simpson family in The Simpsons. He
            is the only son of Homer and Marge Simpson, and the older brother of Lisa and Maggie. He also has been
            nicknamed "Cosmo", after discovering a comet in "Bart's Comet". Bart has also been on the cover on numerous
            comics, such as "Critical Hit", "Simpsons Treasure Trove #11", and "Winter Wingding". Bart also has a
            100-issue comic series entitled the Simpson Comics Presents Bart Simpson. Bart is loosely based on Matt
            Groening and his older brother, Mark Groening.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>“I didn't do it!”
                ―Bart's earlier catchphrase

            <li>“Eat my shorts!”
                ―Bart's second catchphrase

            <li>“I’m Bart Simpson, who the hell are you?”

        <p>
            Lisa Marie Simpson (born May 9)[9] is the elder daughter and middle child of the Simpson family and one of
            the two tritagonists (along with Marge,) of The Simpsons series.

            In "Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words" she is also known as Lisa Bouvier. She was named after a train
            called Lil' Lisa on her parents' 1st anniversary. She is a charismatic 8-year-old girl, who exceeds the
            standard achievement of the intelligence level of children her age. Not to everyone's surprise, she is also
            the moral center of her family. In her upbringing, Lisa lacks parental involvement of Homer and Marge, which
            leads to hobbies such as playing saxophone and guitar, riding and caring for horses, and interest in
            advanced studies. In school, Lisa's popularity is affected by those who view her as a geeky overachiever,
            which leaves her with only a few friends. She focuses on her goals and strives to reach her potential, and
            at the age of eight, she is already a member of Mensa with an IQ of 159. Her lack of parental involvement
            also leads to her lashing out to those who she deems lower than her or even above her. She has extreme
            jealously from time to time and will do whatever it takes to reclaim her title as the smartest; but only if
            she deems it necessary. Otherwise, she's the intelligent one who usually thinks things through.
